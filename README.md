#AWS Sidebar for Chrome

A chrome extension to help you navigate the AWS console a little more efficiently.

Lets you build a custom list of shortcuts to management console screens (including "deep" links to some of the commonly-used subscreens, like "EC2 Instances" instead of just "EC2").

Also lets you customize a list of shortcuts to the pricing pages for your favorite services.
